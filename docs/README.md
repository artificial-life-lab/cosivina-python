# Cosivina

This is a python library to Compose, Simulate and Visualize Neurodynamic Architectures (COSIVINA).

The approach of constructing dynamic field architectures is described in the book <a href="https://dynamicfieldtheory.org/book" target="_blank"> Dynamic Thinking - A Primer on Dynamic Field Theory</a>.

The original Matlab code can be found at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sschneegans/cosivina" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/sschneegans/cosivina</a>.

The goal is to extend this codebase for other artificial life experiments such as connecting population dynamics to agent evolution and adaptability.

At the moment, I can't devote much time to this project due to my other projects and funding issues, which is quite common of researchers in Artificial Life.
However, I would be very happpy if someone finds this approach interesting and wants to work with me to work on this project.
